# Airbnb Clone Backend Architecture

This repository contains the backend system design and implementation details of an **Airbnb Clone**.  
The architecture is designed for scalability, modularity, and integration with external services.  

---

## üìå System Architecture Overview

The backend is built around a **modular service-oriented design**.  
The flowchart diagram illustrates the following components:

### 1. **Users**
- Guests: Can search, book, and pay for properties.  
- Hosts: Can list and manage properties.  
- Admin: Manages the platform, resolves disputes, verifies users, and monitors payments.

### 2. **Core Backend Services**
- **Authentication Service**: Handles user login, registration, JWT/session authentication, and role management.  
- **Property Service**: Manages property listings, availability, amenities, and images.  
- **Booking Service**: Handles reservations, booking status, cancellations, and schedules.  
- **Payments Service**: Manages transactions, payment history, refunds, and payouts.  
- **Notification Service**: Sends booking confirmations, reminders, and system alerts via email/SMS.  

### 3. **Database**
The database stores persistent records for:
- `Users` (guests, hosts, admins)  
- `Properties` (listings, details, availability)  
- `Bookings` (reservations, cancellations)  
- `Payments` (transaction history, refunds, payouts)  
- `Notifications` (user messages, alerts)  

### 4. **External Services**
The backend integrates with external APIs for additional functionality:
- **Payment Gateway** (Stripe/PayPal) ‚Üí Processes guest payments & host payouts.  
- **Email/SMS Provider** (SendGrid, Twilio) ‚Üí Delivers confirmations, alerts, and reminders.  
- **Maps API** (Google Maps) ‚Üí Enables location-based search and property mapping.  

### 5. **Admin Panel**
- Access to all user, booking, and payment records.  
- Fraud detection & dispute resolution.  
- Ability to suspend users or deactivate properties.  
- Analytics dashboard for system monitoring.

## ‚ö° Flow of Operations
1. A **Guest** searches for properties (via Property Service).  
2. A **Booking** is created once a guest selects a property.  
3. The **Payment Service** processes transactions and updates the DB.  
4. The **Notification Service** sends confirmations/alerts.  
5. The **Admin** monitors activities, manages disputes, and accesses records.

## üìÇ Database Schema (High-Level)
- **Users**: `user_id`, `name`, `email`, `role`, `phone`  
- **Properties**: `property_id`, `host_id`, `location`, `price`, `availability`  
- **Bookings**: `booking_id`, `user_id`, `property_id`, `status`, `dates`  
- **Payments**: `payment_id`, `booking_id`, `user_id`, `amount`, `method`, `status`  
- **Notifications**: `notification_id`, `user_id`, `message`, `status`

## üöÄ Tech Stack
- **Backend**: Node.js / Django / FastAPI  
- **Database**: PostgreSQL / MySQL  
- **Authentication**: JWT / OAuth  
- **External APIs**: Stripe, PayPal, Twilio, SendGrid, Google Maps  
- **Containerization**: Docker & Kubernetes (for scaling)
